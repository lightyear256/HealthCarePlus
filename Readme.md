# Mini Healthcare Support Web App
  
The objective is to demonstrate clarity of design, backend–frontend integration, and an AI-powered support idea for NGOs.

---

## Project Overview

The application allows users (Patients and Volunteers) to register, log in, and interact through a simple healthcare support system.  
An AI chatbot powered by Google Gemini (gemini-flash) is integrated to provide instant guidance and health-related information.

The project focuses on usability, structure, and AI integration rather than production-level completeness.

## NGO Use Case

Healthcare NGOs often face challenges such as:
- Limited number of volunteers
- High volume of patient queries
- Delayed responses for basic health-related questions

This application helps NGOs by:
- Providing instant responses to common patient questions using AI
- Reducing repetitive workload for volunteers
- Improving response time and accessibility
- Allowing volunteers to focus on more critical cases

## AI and Automation Idea

### AI Chatbot using Gemini Flash

- Implemented using Google Generative AI (Gemini `gemini-flash` model)
- Designed to answer general healthcare-related questions
- Provides contextual and user-friendly responses
- Acts as a first-level support assistant

The chatbot does not replace medical professionals and does not provide medical diagnoses or prescriptions.
